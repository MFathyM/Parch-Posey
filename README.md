# Parch-Posey
The project aims at exploring the Parch & Posey database which is a paper company (not a real company) and the database includes sales data for their paper. Four SQL queries were written to answer some questions and help understand the company's web traffic, customers and employees, and their order information. Eventually, the outcomes were visualized in Python to describe the findings behind each question.
